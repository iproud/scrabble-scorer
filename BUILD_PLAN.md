# Scrabble Scorer - Real-Time Tile Placement System Build Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive build plan for implementing a core real-time tile placement system in the Scrabble Scorer application. This new approach makes tile placement a fundamental mechanic rather than a preview overlay system.

---

## Phase 2: Core Real-Time Tile Placement ðŸŽ¯
*Goal: Implement fundamental real-time tile placement as core game mechanic*

### Real-Time Board Integration
- [ ] Modify board rendering to support temporary tile placement
- [ ] Implement tile state management (temporary vs permanent)
- [ ] Add real-time tile addition/removal methods
- [ ] Create smooth animations for tile appearance/disappearance
- [ ] Add visual styling for different tile states

### Real-Time Input System
- [ ] Intercept word input keystrokes for real-time processing
- [ ] Calculate board positions for each letter dynamically
- [ ] Implement backspace handling for tile removal
- [ ] Add immediate visual feedback for each keystroke
- [ ] Optimize for mobile typing experience

### Enhanced Scoring Panel
- [ ] Redesign tile display component for better visibility
- [ ] Add state indicators (temporary, permanent, conflict, existing)
- [ ] Implement real-time score calculation updates
- [ ] Add mobile-optimized tile layout
- [ ] Create primary reference for word composition

### Tile State Management
- [ ] **Temporary Tiles**: Letters being typed (removable by backspace)
- [ ] **Permanent Tiles**: Letters from submitted turns (cannot be removed)
- [ ] **Conflict Tiles**: Invalid placements (wrong letters, out of bounds)
- [ ] **Existing Tiles**: Already placed tiles on the board
- [ ] Implement state transitions and validation

### Validation Integration
- [ ] Integrate real-time validation with tile placement
- [ ] Add visual feedback for invalid placements
- [ ] Implement conflict detection and visualization
- [ ] Add premium square bonus indicators
- [ ] Provide immediate validation feedback

### Mobile Optimization
- [ ] Optimize tile display for mobile screens
- [ ] Ensure scoring panel is primary reference on mobile
- [ ] Add touch-friendly interactions
- [ ] Implement responsive design improvements
- [ ] Test on various mobile devices

## Phase 3: State Management & Flow Control ðŸŽ®
*Goal: Implement robust state management for temporary tiles and game flow*

### Turn State Management
- [ ] Implement temporary tile state tracking
- [ ] Handle cancel/reset operations (clear temporary tiles)
- [ ] Manage submit operation (convert temporary to permanent)
- [ ] Handle direction changes and position changes
- [ ] Add state persistence and recovery

### Game Flow Integration
- [ ] Integrate with existing validation pipeline
- [ ] Maintain compatibility with existing game logic
- [ ] Handle edge cases and error conditions
- [ ] Add proper error handling and recovery
- [ ] Ensure smooth user experience

### Board State Synchronization
- [ ] Maintain board state consistency during real-time updates
- [ ] Handle concurrent tile operations
- [ ] Implement proper state locking during calculations
- [ ] Add board state validation and consistency checks
- [ ] Optimize performance for real-time updates

---

## Phase 4: Testing & Validation ðŸ§ª
*Goal: Ensure system reliability and user experience through comprehensive testing*

### Unit Testing
- [ ] Test real-time tile placement logic
- [ ] Test tile state management
- [ ] Test validation integration
- [ ] Test mobile optimizations
- [ ] Test edge cases and error conditions

### Integration Testing
- [ ] Test with existing validation systems
- [ ] Test with premium square tracking
- [ ] Test with tile validator integration
- [ ] Test with game state management
- [ ] Test backward compatibility

### User Experience Testing
- [ ] Test typing experience on desktop and mobile
- [ ] Test cancel/reset operations
- [ ] Test submit operations
- [ ] Test visual feedback and validation
- [ ] Test accessibility and usability

### Performance Testing
- [ ] Test real-time update performance
- [ ] Test mobile device performance
