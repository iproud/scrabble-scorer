# Phase 2: Core Architecture Changes - Implementation Checklist

## 1. Event-Driven Architecture (Foundation)
- [ ] Create EventBus class with publish/subscribe pattern
- [ ] Define event types: gameState, placement, validation, ui, network
- [ ] Add event logging and debugging capabilities
- [ ] Create event handler registration system
- [ ] Add event history tracking for debugging
- [ ] Integrate EventBus with existing app.js
- [ ] Test event propagation and handling

## 2. State Machine Implementation
- [ ] Design state machine states and transitions
- [ ] Create PlacementState class with proper phases
- [ ] Implement state transition logic with validation
- [ ] Add state persistence and recovery mechanisms
- [ ] Create state guards and validation rules
- [ ] Integrate with EventBus for state change notifications
- [ ] Test state machine transitions and edge cases

## 3. Validation Pipeline
- [ ] Design validator chain architecture
- [ ] Create ValidationPipeline class with chainable validators
- [ ] Implement BoundaryValidator for board edge validation
- [ ] Implement ConnectionValidator for word connection rules
- [ ] Implement TileAvailabilityValidator for tile supply checks
- [ ] Implement WordFormationValidator for word structure rules
- [ ] Add validator configuration and extensibility
- [ ] Create comprehensive error reporting system
- [ ] Migrate existing validation logic to new pipeline
- [ ] Test validation pipeline with all scenarios

## 4. Unified Placement State
- [ ] Create PlacementState class to consolidate scattered state
- [ ] Identify and migrate scattered state variables from app.js
- [ ] Add state synchronization across components
- [ ] Implement state validation and consistency checks
- [ ] Add state change notifications via EventBus
- [ ] Integrate with existing UI components
- [ ] Test unified state management

## 5. Error Handling System
- [ ] Create ErrorHandler class with error categorization
- [ ] Define error types: BLOCKING, WARNING, INFO, NETWORK
- [ ] Implement error handling strategies for each type
- [ ] Add error recovery mechanisms where possible
- [ ] Create error reporting and logging system
- [ ] Integrate with existing error scenarios
- [ ] Test error handling and recovery

## 6. Integration and Migration
- [ ] Refactor app.js to use new architecture components
- [ ] Refactor game-state.js to use new validation and state management
- [ ] Replace direct method calls with events where appropriate
- [ ] Update existing UI components to use unified state
- [ ] Migrate validation logic to new pipeline
- [ ] Add backward compatibility layer during transition
- [ ] Test all existing functionality with new architecture

## 7. Testing and Validation
- [ ] Create integration tests for EventBus
- [ ] Create integration tests for state machine
- [ ] Create integration tests for validation pipeline
- [ ] Create integration tests for placement state
- [ ] Create integration tests for error handling
- [ ] Run regression tests for all existing functionality
- [ ] Test edge cases and error scenarios
- [ ] Verify no breaking changes to existing features

## 8. Code Cleanup and Documentation
- [ ] Remove redundant code from app.js and game-state.js
- [ ] Add deprecation warnings for methods to be removed in Phase 3
- [ ] Update code comments and documentation
- [ ] Create architecture documentation
- [ ] Performance testing and optimization
- [ ] Final code review and cleanup

## Progress Tracking
- **Total Tasks:** 47
- **Completed:** 0
- **In Progress:** 0
- **Blocked:** 0

## Notes
- Maintain backward compatibility throughout implementation
- Test each component independently before integration
- Keep existing functionality working at all times
- Document all architectural decisions and trade-offs
